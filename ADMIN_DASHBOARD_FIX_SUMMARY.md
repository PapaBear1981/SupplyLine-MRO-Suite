# Admin Dashboard Navigation Fix

## Issue
Admin users were unable to access the admin dashboard - they were being redirected to the main dashboard instead.

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch in authentication logic between two components:

1. **AdminRoute component** (in `frontend/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
   - Checked `user?.is_admin` ✅ (passed)

2. **AdminDashboardPage component** (in `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboardPage.jsx`)
   - Checked for specific permissions array with prefixes `['user.', 'role.', 'system.']` ❌ (failed)

The user data returned from the backend included `is_admin: true` but did not include the `permissions` field, causing the AdminDashboardPage to redirect users even though they passed the route protection.

## Solution
Updated `AdminDashboardPage.jsx` to use the same authentication logic as `AdminRoute`:

**Before:**
```javascript
// Check if user has any admin permissions
const hasAdminPermissions = user?.permissions?.some(permission =>
  ADMIN_PERMISSION_PREFIXES.some(prefix => permission.startsWith(prefix))
);

// Redirect if user doesn't have admin permissions
if (!hasAdminPermissions) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Check if user is admin - use the same logic as AdminRoute component
// This ensures consistency with the routing protection
if (!user?.is_admin) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
}
```

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboardPage.jsx`

## Testing Results
✅ **Admin dashboard access verified:**
- Navigation link in main navigation bar works
- Quick Actions button on user dashboard works
