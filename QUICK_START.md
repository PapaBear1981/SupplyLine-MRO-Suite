# Quick Start Guide - User Management Refactoring

## Overview
This guide will help you quickly get started with testing the new Roles and Departments management features.

## Prerequisites
- Backend server running
- Frontend development server running
- Admin user credentials

## Starting the Application

### Backend
```bash
cd SupplyLine-MRO-Suite/backend
# Activate virtual environment if needed
python app.py
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd SupplyLine-MRO-Suite/frontend
npm start
```

## Quick Test Flow

### 1. Access User Management (30 seconds)

   - Name: "Test Role"
   - Description: "This is a test role"
7. Switch to the "Permissions" tab

### 4. Test System Role Protection (1 minute)

1. In the Roles modal, find "Administrator" role
2. Notice it has a "System Role" badge
3. Try to click the **edit** button - it should be there but...
4. Click the **"Permissions"** button - this SHOULD work
5. Modify some permissions
6. Click **"Save Permissions"** - this SHOULD work
7. Try to click the **delete** button - it should be disabled/hidden

## Visual Checklist

### Departments Modal Should Have:
- âœ… Search box at the top
- âœ… "Add New Department" button
- âœ… Table with columns: Name, Description, Status, Actions
- âœ… Active/Inactive badges
- âœ… Three action buttons per row: Edit, Toggle Active, Delete
- âœ… Smooth animations on hover
- âœ… Confirmation dialog for delete

### Roles Modal Should Have:
- âœ… Search box at the top
- âœ… "Add New Role" button
- âœ… Table with columns: Role Name, Description, Permissions, Type, Actions
- âœ… Permission count badges
- âœ… System Role badges for system roles
- âœ… Three action buttons: Permissions, Edit, Delete
- âœ… Edit and Delete disabled for system roles
- âœ… Permissions button enabled for all roles

### Permission Tree Should Have:
- âœ… Categories that expand/collapse
- âœ… Category icons showing selection state (all/partial/none)
- âœ… "Select All" / "Deselect All" per category
- âœ… Individual permission checkboxes
- âœ… Permission descriptions
- âœ… Total count at the bottom
- âœ… Global "Clear All" and "Select All" buttons

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Buttons not showing
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as a user with `user.manage` and `role.manage` permissions

### Issue: Modal not opening
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Make sure backend is running.

### Issue: Changes not saving
**Solution**: Check network tab for failed requests. Verify backend is running and accessible.

### Issue: Permission tree not loading
**Solution**: Verify the `/api/permissions/categories` endpoint is working. Check backend logs.

### Issue: Can't delete system roles
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. System roles are protected from deletion.

### Issue: Styling looks broken
**Solution**: Make sure all CSS files are loaded. Check browser console for 404 errors.

## API Endpoints to Verify

### Departments
```bash
# Get all departments (including inactive)
GET http://localhost:5000/api/departments?include_inactive=true

# Create department
POST http://localhost:5000/api/departments
Body: {"name": "Test", "description": "Test dept"}

# Update department
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/departments/1
Body: {"name": "Updated", "description": "Updated desc"}

# Soft delete (deactivate)
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/departments/1

# Hard delete (permanent)
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/departments/1/hard-delete
```

### Roles

# Get all roles
GET http://localhost:5000/api/roles

# Get role with permissions

Body: {"name": "Test", "description": "Test role", "permissions": [1, 2, 3]}

# Update role (including permissions)
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/roles/1
Body: {"permissions": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

# Delete role
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/roles/1
```

### Permissions
```bash
