# Tasks: Update Specification to Create a Comprehensive Security Review of the Current Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-update-specification-to/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No automated test tasks were requested. Verification occurs through documented evidence reviews and stakeholder sign-offs.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Documentation assets live under `docs/security_review/`
- Feature working papers remain in `specs/002-update-specification-to/`
- Release coordination artefacts live at repository root (`CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, etc.)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish research context and assemble existing security artefacts.

- [ ] T001 [Setup] Compile existing security artefacts and references into `specs/002-update-specification-to/research.md` (SECURITY_* docs, RELEASE_NOTES.md, CHANGELOG.md, DEPLOYMENT.md).
- [ ] T002 [Setup] Document automated security tooling coverage (CI scans, dependency checks, Playwright security suites) in `specs/002-update-specification-to/research.md`.
- [ ] T003 [Setup] Record stakeholder roster (security, engineering, operations leads) and availability windows in `specs/002-update-specification-to/research.md`.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Create shared documentation structure and baseline data definitions required by all stories.  
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [ ] T004 [Foundation] Create `docs/security_review/README.md` outlining directory structure, version control expectations, and document ownership rules.
- [ ] T005 [Foundation] Establish control, evidence, risk, and remediation data definitions in `specs/002-update-specification-to/data-model.md`.
- [ ] T006 [Foundation] Log current risk posture summary and outstanding security actions in `specs/002-update-specification-to/research.md` (helps prioritize blueprint scope).

**Checkpoint**: Documentation structure, data definitions, and baseline risk context confirmed.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Define the security review blueprint (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Deliver a comprehensive blueprint covering scope, control catalog, evidence sources, timelines, and owners.  
**Independent Test**: Auditor reviews `docs/security_review/blueprint.md` and confirms it enumerates scope, control families, evidence locations, accountable owners, and timeline milestones with no omissions.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T007 [US1] Create `docs/security_review/blueprint.md` with executive summary, table of contents, and core section placeholders.
- [ ] T008 [US1] Document in-scope systems, control families, and evaluation objectives within `docs/security_review/blueprint.md`, referencing artefacts from T001‚ÄìT006.
- [ ] T009 [US1] Map evidence sources (logs, configs, test outputs) to each control in `docs/security_review/blueprint.md`.
- [ ] T010 [US1] Define owner assignments, timeline milestones, and approval checkpoints in `docs/security_review/blueprint.md`.

**Checkpoint**: Blueprint complete and ready for stakeholder review.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Collect evidence and assess controls (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable analysts to gather evidence, execute assessments, and record outcomes for every control.  
**Independent Test**: Reviewer inspects `docs/security_review/control_evidence_catalog.md` and `specs/002-update-specification-to/quickstart.md` to verify each control lists required artifacts, assessment steps, status fields, and escalation paths.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T011 [US2] Build evidence catalog template with control IDs, evidence fields, status, reviewer, and severity columns in `docs/security_review/control_evidence_catalog.md`.
- [ ] T012 [US2] Draft step-by-step evidence collection workflow (log exports, configuration snapshots, manual checks) in `specs/002-update-specification-to/quickstart.md`.
- [ ] T013 [P] [US2] Capture tooling access requirements, command references, and log locations in `docs/security_review/tooling_playbook.md`.
- [ ] T014 [US2] Define assessment scoring rubric and compensation documentation requirements in `docs/security_review/control_evidence_catalog.md`.

**Checkpoint**: Evidence capture workflow validated and catalog ready for population.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Report outcomes and track remediation (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide reporting templates and remediation tracking to communicate risks and manage follow-up actions.  
**Independent Test**: Governance reviewer opens `docs/security_review/reporting_playbook.md`, `docs/security_review/risk_register.md`, and `docs/security_review/remediation_tracker.md` and verifies risk summaries, remediation assignments, and release alignment are documented.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T015 [US3] Create `docs/security_review/reporting_playbook.md` describing final report structure, audience, sign-off process, and communication plan.
- [ ] T016 [US3] Produce `docs/security_review/risk_register.md` template with risk description, impact/likelihood scoring, affected assets, and mitigation guidance.
- [ ] T017 [US3] Produce `docs/security_review/remediation_tracker.md` template capturing owners, target dates, verification steps, and linkage to release artefacts.
- [ ] T018 [US3] Document change-propagation checklist in `docs/security_review/reporting_playbook.md`, ensuring updates to `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, and deployment guides are triggered by remediation work.

**Checkpoint**: Reporting toolkit finalized; remediation tracking process defined.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Align deliverables, validate consistency, and prepare for stakeholder adoption.

- [ ] T019 [Polish] Cross-link all security review documents in `docs/security_review/README.md` and ensure versioning metadata is present.
- [ ] T020 [Polish] Conduct self-review of blueprint, catalog, and reporting artefacts; record readiness notes in `specs/002-update-specification-to/checklists/requirements.md`.
- [ ] T021 [Polish] Prepare summary update for `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` describing completion of the security review documentation package.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Setup (Phase 1)** ‚Üí unlocks Foundational work.  
- **Foundational (Phase 2)** ‚Üí required before starting any user story tasks.  
- **User Story Phases**: Execute in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3). Later stories rely on outputs from earlier phases (e.g., blueprint informs evidence catalog, catalog informs reporting).  
- **Polish** executes after US3 completes.

Story-level dependencies:
- US1 has no prior story dependency once Foundational is complete.
- US2 depends on US1‚Äôs blueprint to align control IDs and evidence expectations.
- US3 depends on US2‚Äôs evidence catalog to populate reporting and remediation templates.

---

## Parallel Opportunities

- T001‚ÄìT003 share a file and should run sequentially.  
- T004, T005, and T006 touch different files; T005 and T006 can proceed in parallel once T004 is finished.  
- Within US2, T013 targets a distinct file and may proceed in parallel after T011 lays out catalog fields.  
- Within US3, T016 and T017 operate on separate templates and can run concurrently once T015 establishes reporting context.

Example parallel execution for US2:
```bash
# After T011 completes:
Run T013 (tooling playbook) and T014 (scoring rubric) concurrently
# Ensure both reference the finalized catalog structure from T011
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
1. Complete Phases 1‚Äì2 to establish context and shared structure.  
2. Deliver US1 blueprint (T007‚ÄìT010).  
3. Review blueprint with stakeholders to validate scope before expanding effort.

### Incremental Delivery
1. Baseline (Setup + Foundational)  
2. US1 ‚Äì Blueprint (MVP)  
3. US2 ‚Äì Evidence workflows  
4. US3 ‚Äì Reporting & remediation  
5. Polish ‚Äì Cross-doc consistency and release notes

### Parallel Team Strategy
- Documentation specialist handles US1 blueprint.  
- Security analyst builds US2 evidence catalog and tooling playbook (informed by blueprint).  
- Governance lead produces US3 reporting toolkit once evidence catalog exists.  
- A coordinator manages Phase N polish and release communication.
