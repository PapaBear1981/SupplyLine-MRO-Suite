# Implementation Plan: Update Specification to Create a Comprehensive Security Review of the Current Application

**Branch**: `002-update-specification-to` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-update-specification-to/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan orchestrates the analysis and documentation updates required to execute the comprehensive security review outlined in the spec. Implementation relies on existing application knowledge and security artefacts; no production code changes occur in this phase.

## Summary

- Produce an exhaustive security review blueprint summarising scope, control catalogues, timelines, and accountable owners across backend (Flask API), frontend (Vite/React), infrastructure (AWS CloudFormation, Docker), and automation scripts.
- Inventory current tooling (pytest, Playwright, CI security scans, logging pipelines) to confirm coverage and document any required enhancements ahead of evidence gathering.
- Define evidence collection workflows, repositories, and reporting formats so analysts can execute the review and deliver the risk register and remediation tracker.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.x (Flask backend), Node.js (React 19 frontend), Shell scripting for automation  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT-based auth libraries, Vite/React ecosystem, Playwright for E2E, AWS CloudFormation templates  
**Storage**: SQLite for local, PostgreSQL/Aurora assumed in production via migrations  
**Testing**: `pytest` with security-focused suites, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npx playwright test`, CI pipelines with security checks  
**Target Platform**: AWS-hosted services with Dockerized deployment; local dev via docker-compose  
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: Maintain hardened security posture; rapid remediation workflow (<15 business days for high findings)  
**Constraints**: Zero-trust requirements (env-driven secrets, rate limiting, sanitized logs), compliance audit readiness, independence of user stories  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise MRO management suite supporting multi-location operations and regulated asset tracking

## Constitution Check

- Security posture confirmed: audit blueprint will verify environment-secret handling, rate limiting, password lifecycle, and logging standards against `SECURITY_SETUP.md` and `ENHANCED_ERROR_HANDLING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- Test strategy documented: plan references existing `pytest`, lint, build, and Playwright suites to ensure failing-first evidence accompanies security assessments.
- Story independence validated: each workstream (blueprint creation, evidence collection readiness, reporting framework) produces standalone, reviewable deliverables.
- Change propagation outlined: outputs will enumerate impacts to `backend/`, `frontend/`, `migrations/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, and release artefacts (`CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `VERSION.md`) when remediation is scheduled.
- Observability updates planned: blueprint includes logging, monitoring, and alert validation steps with corresponding updates to runtime scripts (`start_dev_servers.sh`, `docker-compose.yml`) if gaps are found.

**Structure Decision**: Treat repository as a standard web application with coordinated backend/frontend components and shared documentation & automation directories integral to the security review.

## Execution Plan

### Phase 0 – Research & Scope Confirmation

- Inventory existing security artefacts (`SECURITY_*`, `ENHANCED_ERROR_HANDLING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, AWS CloudFormation templates) and map to control families.
- Interview/appraise current security tooling (static analysis, dependency scanning, CI checks) to confirm availability and freshness.
- Produce initial risk landscape summary referencing prior audit findings and outstanding remediation tasks.

### Phase 1 – Blueprint & Control Catalogue

- Draft security review blueprint describing scope, control objectives, evidence locations, responsible owners, and schedule milestones.
- Define control taxonomy and data structures for the control evidence catalog, risk register, and remediation tracker; capture in `data-model.md`.
- Prepare standardized assessment templates (checklists, approval forms) in `contracts/` to ensure consistent evidence capture.

### Phase 2 – Evidence Collection Enablement

- Document evidence collection workflows, including log exports, configuration snapshot procedures, and manual verification steps.
- Align tooling requirements (access permissions, scripts, command references) and note gaps requiring remediation enablement.
- Outline validation steps for automated tests (`pytest`, Playwright) that deliver security evidence; specify failing-first expectations.

### Phase 3 – Reporting Framework

- Design final reporting structure: executive summary, detailed findings, compliance mapping, remediation tracker linkage.
- Specify communication plan for stakeholders, including review cadence, approval checkpoints, and escalation paths.
- Document change-propagation requirements to update `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, and operational guides when remediation ships.

### Phase 4 – Readiness & Handoff

- Consolidate outcome metrics and success criteria to monitor review progress (coverage %, turnaround time, remediation status).
- Prepare checklist for launch readiness of the security review, including permissions, tooling verification, and stakeholder commitments.
- Finalize documentation package (quickstart, evidence templates, reporting guide) and secure sign-off from security leadership.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Outdated security artefacts lead to incomplete blueprint.  
  **Mitigation**: Cross-verify each artefact’s last-updated timestamp against `VERSION.md` and release notes; flag discrepancies for immediate refresh.

- **Risk**: Limited access to production logs or monitoring data delays evidence collection.  
  **Mitigation**: Include access verification tasks in Phase 0 and secure temporary credentials or sanitized exports before Phase 2.

- **Risk**: Stakeholder bandwidth constraints cause sign-off delays.  
  **Mitigation**: Build approval scheduling into blueprint and align with program governance calendar during Phase 0.

- **Risk**: Tooling gaps discovered late in review.  
  **Mitigation**: Conduct tooling capability assessment in Phase 0 and maintain escalation path for rapid onboarding of supplemental tools.

## Deliverables

- Security review blueprint (docs/) capturing scope, controls, owners, and schedule.
- Control evidence catalog schema and populated templates ready for analyst use.
- Risk register and remediation tracker frameworks with operational guidance.
- Reporting package and stakeholder communication plan aligned to governance expectations.

## Acceptance Gates

1. Blueprint reviewed and approved by security lead and operations counterpart.
2. Evidence collection workflows validated via dry-run on select controls.
3. Reporting templates accepted by governance reviewer with compliance mapping included.
4. Remediation tracker framework connected to release artefact process (CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES updates).
