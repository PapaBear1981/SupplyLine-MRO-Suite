# Feature Specification: Dependency and Infrastructure Hardening Sprint

**Short Name**: dependency-infra-hardening
**Branch Name**: feat/dependency-infra-hardening
**Date**: 2025-10-15

## 1. Overview

This specification outlines the necessary steps to address critical security and infrastructure deficiencies identified in the Code Review Report, specifically within the Dependency & Infrastructure Updates section. The goal is to improve the security posture of the application by updating vulnerable dependencies, enforcing secure configuration, and preparing the environment for modern development standards.

## 2. Goals

1.  Eliminate known critical vulnerabilities (CVEs/GHSA) in both Python and JavaScript dependencies.
2.  Improve build and deployment stability by pinning all transitive dependencies.
3.  Enforce secure configuration defaults for the backend application (Bandit findings).
4.  Update project documentation to reflect current technology requirements (React 19, Node 20+).
5.  Implement foundational infrastructure security controls (network segmentation and secrets management).

## 3. User Scenarios & Acceptance Criteria

Since this is an infrastructure and dependency update, the primary "user" is the developer/operator.

| Scenario | Actor | Action | Expected Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dependency Audit** | Developer | Run `pip-audit` and `npm audit` | No high or critical vulnerabilities are reported in the project dependencies. |
| **Local Development Setup** | Developer | Follow the updated `README.md` setup instructions | The development environment initializes successfully using React 19 and Node 20+. |
| **Secure Deployment** | Operator | Deploy the application using `docker-compose` | Services are isolated on a dedicated network, and sensitive configuration data is loaded securely via a secrets mechanism. |
| **Static Analysis** | Developer | Run Bandit static analysis on the backend | Bandit findings B201, B104, and B108 are no longer flagged as high-severity issues in non-development environments. |

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR 4.1: Dependency Vulnerability Remediation
The system must use updated versions of dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- FR 4.1.1: The Python packaging toolchain must be upgraded to address GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph (pip vulnerability).
- FR 4.1.2: The frontend dependencies must be updated to fix the following vulnerabilities:
    - axios CVE (GHSA-86c3-c7mf-4j9j)
    - jspdf/jspdf-autotable ReDoS vulnerability
    - form-data RNG vulnerability
    - xlsx prototype pollution vulnerability

### FR 4.2: Dependency Pinning
- FR 4.2.1: All transitive dependencies in `backend/requirements.txt` must be explicitly pinned to ensure reproducible builds.

### FR 4.3: Backend Security Configuration
The backend application must adhere to secure configuration standards.
- FR 4.3.1: Bandit finding B201 (debug=True) must be addressed by ensuring debug mode is disabled in production environments.
- FR 4.3.2: Bandit finding B104 (0.0.0.0 bind) must be addressed by restricting the host binding to a secure interface in production environments.
- FR 4.3.3: Bandit finding B108 (temp file usage) must be reviewed and mitigated.

### FR 4.4: Documentation Update
- FR 4.4.1: The `README.md` must be updated to clearly state the new requirements for React 19 and Node 20+.

### FR 4.5: Infrastructure Hardening
The containerized environment must implement foundational security controls.
- FR 4.5.1: `docker-compose.yml` must be updated to configure network segmentation, isolating the backend and frontend services from the default bridge network.
- FR 4.5.2: Sensitive configuration data must be loaded exclusively via environment variables, deferring dedicated secrets management solutions.

## 5. Success Criteria

1.  **Vulnerability Elimination**: All high and critical CVEs/GHSA advisories listed in the Dependency Health section of the code review report are resolved.
2.  **Build Reproducibility**: The application can be built consistently across environments using the pinned dependencies, reducing unexpected runtime errors.
3.  **Secure Defaults**: The application defaults to secure configurations (e.g., debug disabled, restricted binding) when deployed outside of a development context.
4.  **Operator Experience**: Developers and operators can set up the project using the updated documentation without encountering environment compatibility issues.
5.  **Infrastructure Security**: Services running via `docker-compose` are isolated on a dedicated network, and secrets are managed securely.

## 6. Assumptions

- Dependency updates will be performed using standard package management tools (`pip`, `npm`) and will target the latest stable versions that resolve the reported vulnerabilities.
- Addressing Bandit findings B201 and B104 will involve configuration changes (e.g., using environment variables or configuration files) rather than removing the functionality entirely, allowing for development mode usage.

## 7. Dependencies

- Access to the project's `backend/requirements.txt`, `frontend/package.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `README.md` files.
- Successful execution of unit and integration tests after dependency updates to ensure no breaking changes were introduced.
