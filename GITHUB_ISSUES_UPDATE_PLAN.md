### 🔄 UPDATE: Issue #326 - Critical: Token Validation Issues - API Endpoints Returning 401 Errors

**Status**: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED - Needs Further Investigation

**Progress Made**:
- ✅ Database connectivity issues resolved (was contributing factor)
- ✅ Database initialization working correctly
- ✅ Admin user created successfully
- ❌ Login endpoint still returning 500 errors (separate from database issues)

**Update Comment**:
```
🔄 **PROGRESS UPDATE** - Database connectivity issues resolved, but login endpoint still needs attention.

**What was fixed**:
- ✅ Resolved underlying database connection issues that were contributing to authentication problems
- ✅ Database initialization now working correctly
- ✅ Admin user (ADMIN001) created successfully with proper password hashing
- ✅ Database tables created and accessible

**Current Status**:
- ❌ Login endpoint `/api/auth/login` still returning 500 internal server error
- ❌ Authentication flow not completing successfully
- ✅ Database connectivity no longer the root cause

**Next Steps Required**:
1. Investigate Flask application context issues in login route
2. Check JWT token generation and validation logic
3. Verify SECRET_KEY configuration consistency
4. Review authentication middleware and decorators
5. Test login endpoint with proper error logging

**Technical Notes**:
- Database connection: ✅ Working (us-west1 region)
- Database initialization: ✅ Complete
- Admin user: ✅ Created (ADMIN001/admin123)
- Login endpoint: ❌ 500 error (needs investigation)

The database foundation is now solid, but the login logic itself needs debugging.
```

- ✅ Admin user successfully created and accessible
- ✅ Database initialization scripts (`/api/db-init-simple`) working perfectly
- ✅ Database inspection endpoint confirming proper setup

**Ready for Implementation**:
The database foundation is now solid and ready for sample data population. The infrastructure issues that were blocking this work have been resolved.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Create sample data SQL script using the working database schema
2. Add sample tools, chemicals, users, and transactions
3. Use the working `/api/db-init-simple` endpoint as a model for data population
4. Test sample data with the working database connection

**Technical Foundation**:
- Database: PostgreSQL in us-west1 region ✅
- Connection: Working with proper credentials ✅
- Tables: All created with correct schema ✅
- Admin access: ADMIN001 user available ✅

This issue is now unblocked and ready for implementation.
```

### ➡️ KEEP OPEN: Issue #329 - Low: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**Status**: UNCHANGED - Future Enhancement

**Comment**: No changes needed. This remains a valid future enhancement that is not affected by the database connection work.

## New Issues to Create

### 1. Critical: Login Endpoint 500 Error - Authentication Flow Broken

**Priority**: Critical 🔴  
**Labels**: `authentication`, `backend`, `bug`, `critical`, `priority-critical`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Issue Description

**Priority**: Critical 🔴  
**Component**: Backend Authentication  
**Environment**: Production

### Problem

The login endpoint `/api/auth/login` is returning 500 internal server error, preventing users from authenticating even though the database connectivity and user creation are working correctly.

### Current Status

- ✅ Database connection working (us-west1 region)
- ✅ Database initialization complete
- ✅ Admin user (ADMIN001) created successfully
- ✅ Password hashing working correctly
- ❌ Login endpoint returning 500 error
- ❌ Authentication flow broken

### Error Details

```
Status: 500
Response: {"error":"Internal server error"}
```

### Technical Investigation Required

1. **Flask Application Context**: Check if login route has proper application context
2. **Database Session Management**: Verify SQLAlchemy session handling in login route
3. **Password Verification**: Test password hashing/verification logic
4. **JWT Token Generation**: Check SECRET_KEY and token creation
5. **Error Logging**: Add detailed logging to identify exact failure point

### Environment Details

- **Backend URL**: `https://supplyline-backend-production-sukn4msdrq-uw.a.run.app`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (us-west1) - ✅ Working
- **Admin User**: ADMIN001 / admin123 - ✅ Created
- **Database Tables**: ✅ All present and accessible

### Impact

- Users cannot log into the application
- All authenticated functionality is inaccessible
- Application is effectively non-functional for end users

### Related Work

This issue emerged after resolving the database connectivity problems in #327. The database foundation is now solid, but the login logic itself needs debugging.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Login endpoint returns 200 for valid credentials
- [ ] JWT token generated successfully
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Admin user can log in successfully
- [ ] Error logging provides clear debugging information
```

### 2. High: Database Initialization Flag Persistence Issue

**Priority**: High 🟠  
**Labels**: `database`, `backend`, `bug`, `initialization`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Issue Description

**Priority**: High 🟠  
**Component**: Database Initialization  
**Environment**: Production

### Problem

The database initialization flag (`app._db_initialized`) is not persisting across Cloud Run instances, causing some endpoints to return "Database not available" errors even after successful initialization.

### Current Behavior

- ✅ Database tables exist and are accessible
- ✅ `/api/db-init-simple` endpoint works correctly
- ✅ `/api/db-inspect` shows database is properly initialized
- ❌ Some endpoints still check `app._db_initialized` flag and fail
- ❌ Flag is instance-specific and doesn't persist across requests

### Root Cause

Cloud Run can spawn multiple instances, and the `app._db_initialized` flag is only set in memory on the instance that performed the initialization.

### Technical Solution Required

Replace the in-memory flag with a database-based check:

```python
def is_database_initialized():
    """Check if database is initialized by verifying table existence."""
    try:
        from sqlalchemy import text
        from models import db
        with db.engine.connect() as conn:
            result = conn.execute(text("""
                SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
                WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'users'
            """))
            return result.scalar() > 0
    except:
        return False
```

### Files to Update

- `backend/app.py` - Replace `app._db_initialized` checks
- Any middleware that checks database initialization status
- Authentication decorators that verify database availability

### Impact

- Inconsistent behavior across Cloud Run instances
- Some API endpoints fail unnecessarily
- User experience degraded by false "database not available" errors

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database initialization check is instance-independent
- [ ] All endpoints work consistently across Cloud Run instances
- [ ] No false "database not available" errors
- [ ] Initialization check is performant and cached appropriately
```

### 3. Medium: Cloud Build Deployment Configuration Cleanup

**Priority**: Medium 🟡  
**Labels**: `deployment`, `configuration`, `infrastructure`, `cleanup`

**Description**:
```markdown
## Issue Description

**Priority**: Medium 🟡  
**Component**: Deployment Infrastructure  
**Environment**: Production

### Problem

During the database connectivity resolution, multiple Cloud Run services were created with different naming conventions and configurations. The deployment setup needs cleanup and standardization.

### Current State

Multiple backend services exist:
- `supplyline-backend-production` (us-west1) - ✅ Working
- `supplyline-backend-test` (us-west1) - 🧹 Can be removed
- Various URL formats causing confusion

### Required Cleanup

1. **Remove Test Services**: Clean up temporary test services created during debugging
2. **Standardize URLs**: Ensure consistent URL patterns
3. **Update Documentation**: Update all references to use correct service URLs
4. **Verify Frontend Configuration**: Ensure frontend points to correct backend

### Services to Clean Up

```bash
# Remove test service
gcloud run services delete supplyline-backend-test --region=us-west1

# Verify production service configuration
gcloud run services describe supplyline-backend-production --region=us-west1
```

### Files to Update

- `cloudbuild.yaml` - Ensure correct default substitutions
- `README.md` - Update deployment instructions
- `GCP_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Update with final configuration
- Any scripts referencing old service URLs

### Verification Steps

1. Confirm only necessary services exist
2. Verify frontend connects to correct backend
3. Test full deployment process with clean configuration
4. Update documentation with final service URLs

### Benefits

- Cleaner Google Cloud project
- Reduced confusion about service URLs
- Lower costs from unused services
- Standardized deployment process
```
