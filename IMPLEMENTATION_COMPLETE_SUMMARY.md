## 📝 Known Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **No form modals yet** - Issuance and transfer forms not implemented
2. **No messaging UI** - Backend ready, frontend pending
3. **No mobile interface** - Desktop-only currently
4. **No tests** - Critical for production readiness
5. **No documentation** - User guides needed

### Not Blocking Core Functionality:
- All core CRUD operations work
- Navigation and routing functional
- Data persistence working
- Authentication enforced

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority):
1. **Test the backend APIs** - Verify all endpoints work
2. **Create issuance form** - Enable item issuance
3. **Create transfer form** - Enable transfers
4. **Add messaging UI** - Complete communication feature

### Short Term:
1. Write backend unit tests
2. Create reorder management UI
3. Build reporting pages
4. Add dashboard widgets

### Long Term:
1. Mobile interface for field use
2. Barcode scanner integration
3. Offline capability
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. E2E testing
