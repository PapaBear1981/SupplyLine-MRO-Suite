# SupplyLine MRO Suite - Performance Monitoring

This document outlines the performance monitoring setup and optimization strategies for the SupplyLine MRO Suite application.

## Overview

Performance monitoring is essential for maintaining optimal user experience and identifying potential issues before they impact users. This document provides a foundation for implementing comprehensive performance monitoring.

## Current Monitoring Setup

### Google Cloud Monitoring

The application leverages Google Cloud's built-in monitoring capabilities:

- **Cloud Run Metrics**: Automatic collection of request latency, error rates, and resource utilization
- **Cloud SQL Metrics**: Database performance, connection counts, and query performance
- **Cloud Logging**: Structured application logs with performance markers

### Key Metrics Tracked

#### Backend Performance
- **Response Time**: Average API response time across all endpoints
- **Request Rate**: Number of requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests (4xx/5xx status codes)
- **Memory Usage**: Container memory utilization percentage
- **CPU Usage**: Container CPU utilization percentage

#### Database Performance
- **Connection Count**: Number of active database connections
- **Query Performance**: Slow query identification and optimization
- **Connection Pool Usage**: Database connection pool efficiency

#### Frontend Performance
- **Page Load Time**: Time to first contentful paint
- **JavaScript Bundle Size**: Frontend asset optimization
- **API Call Latency**: Frontend to backend communication performance

## Performance Dashboard

A custom Google Cloud Monitoring dashboard has been created (`monitoring/performance-dashboard.json`) that includes:

1. **Backend Response Time Chart**: Tracks API response times over time
2. **Request Rate Chart**: Monitors incoming request volume
3. **Error Rate Chart**: Displays error rates by response code class
4. **Memory Usage Chart**: Shows container memory utilization
5. **CPU Usage Chart**: Tracks CPU utilization patterns
6. **Database Connections Chart**: Monitors active database connections

### Dashboard Deployment

To deploy the performance dashboard:

```bash
# Create the dashboard in Google Cloud Monitoring
gcloud monitoring dashboards create --config-from-file=monitoring/performance-dashboard.json
```

## Performance Baselines

### Current Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| API Response Time | < 500ms | > 2000ms |
| Error Rate | < 1% | > 5% |
| Memory Usage | < 80% | > 95% |
| CPU Usage | < 70% | > 90% |
| Database Connections | < 50 | > 80 |

### Baseline Measurements

*Note: Baseline measurements should be established after initial deployment and sample data population.*

## Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts

1. **High Error Rate**: Alert when error rate exceeds 5% for 5 minutes
2. **High Response Time**: Alert when average response time exceeds 2 seconds for 5 minutes
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Alert when memory or CPU usage exceeds 95% for 3 minutes
4. **Database Issues**: Alert when database connections exceed 80 or connection errors occur

### Alert Configuration

```bash
# Example: Create high error rate alert
gcloud alpha monitoring policies create \
  --policy-from-file=monitoring/alerts/high-error-rate.yaml
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Backend Optimization

1. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Implement query result caching
   - Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Optimize N+1 query patterns

2. **API Response Optimization**

   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Cache frequently accessed data

3. **Resource Management**
   - Optimize container resource allocation
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Use lazy loading for expensive operations

### Frontend Optimization

1. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Code splitting for reduced initial load time
   - Tree shaking to remove unused code
   - Asset compression and minification

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement browser caching for static assets
   - Use service workers for offline functionality
   - Cache API responses where appropriate

3. **User Experience**
   - Implement loading states and progress indicators
   - Use skeleton screens for better perceived performance
   - Optimize images and media assets

### Database Optimization

1. **Query Performance**
   - Regular analysis of slow queries
   - Index optimization based on query patterns
   - Query result caching for expensive operations

2. **Connection Management**
   - Optimize connection pool settings
   - Implement connection retry logic
   - Monitor connection leaks

## Monitoring Tools and Integration

### Built-in Google Cloud Tools

- **Cloud Monitoring**: Metrics collection and dashboards
- **Cloud Logging**: Centralized log aggregation
- **Cloud Trace**: Request tracing and latency analysis
- **Cloud Profiler**: Application performance profiling

### Third-party Options

For advanced monitoring, consider:

- **Datadog**: Infrastructure and application monitoring
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **LogRocket**: Frontend performance and user session recording

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Strategy

1. **Baseline Testing**: Establish performance baselines with realistic user loads
2. **Stress Testing**: Determine breaking points and failure modes
3. **Spike Testing**: Test response to sudden traffic increases
4. **Endurance Testing**: Verify performance over extended periods

### Testing Tools

- **Apache JMeter**: Load testing for API endpoints
- **Lighthouse**: Frontend performance auditing
