## Issue 1: Critical - Login Endpoint 500 Error

**Title**: `Critical: Login Endpoint 500 Error - Authentication Flow Broken`  
**Priority**: Critical 🔴  
**Labels**: `authentication`, `backend`, `bug`, `critical`, `priority-critical`

**Issue Body**:
```markdown
## Issue Description

**Priority**: Critical 🔴  
**Component**: Backend Authentication  
**Environment**: Production

### Problem

The login endpoint `/api/auth/login` is returning 500 internal server error, preventing users from authenticating even though the database connectivity and user creation are working correctly.

### Current Status

- ✅ Database connection working (us-west1 region)
- ✅ Database initialization complete  
- ✅ Admin user (ADMIN001) created successfully
- ✅ Password hashing working correctly
- ❌ Login endpoint returning 500 error
- ❌ Authentication flow broken

### Error Details

**Request**: `POST /api/auth/login`
```json
{
  "employee_number": "ADMIN001",
  "password": "admin123"
}
```

**Response**: 
```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error"
}
```
**Status Code**: 500

### Technical Investigation Required

1. **Flask Application Context**: Check if login route has proper application context
2. **Database Session Management**: Verify SQLAlchemy session handling in login route  
3. **Password Verification**: Test password hashing/verification logic
4. **JWT Token Generation**: Check SECRET_KEY and token creation
5. **Error Logging**: Add detailed logging to identify exact failure point

### Debugging Steps Completed

- ✅ Verified database connectivity works
- ✅ Confirmed admin user exists in database
- ✅ Tested database inspection endpoint (working)
- ✅ Verified password was hashed correctly during user creation
- ❌ Login endpoint still fails with 500 error

### Environment Details

- **Backend URL**: `https://supplyline-backend-production-sukn4msdrq-uw.a.run.app`
- **Frontend URL**: `https://supplyline-frontend-production-454313121816.us-west1.run.app`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (us-west1) - ✅ Working
- **Admin User**: ADMIN001 / admin123 - ✅ Created
- **Database Tables**: ✅ All present and accessible

### Impact

- Users cannot log into the application
- All authenticated functionality is inaccessible  
- Application is effectively non-functional for end users
- Blocks all testing and validation of other features

### Related Work

This issue emerged after resolving the database connectivity problems in #327. The database foundation is now solid, but the login logic itself needs debugging.

### Suggested Investigation Areas

1. **Check Flask route definition**: Verify `/api/auth/login` route is properly registered
2. **Database session handling**: Ensure proper session management in login logic
3. **Password verification**: Test `check_password_hash()` function
4. **JWT configuration**: Verify SECRET_KEY is properly loaded
5. **Error handling**: Add try/catch blocks with detailed logging

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Login endpoint returns 200 for valid credentials
- [ ] JWT token generated successfully  
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Admin user can log in successfully
- [ ] Error logging provides clear debugging information
- [ ] Frontend can successfully authenticate users

### Files Likely Involved

- `backend/app.py` - Login route definition
- `backend/models.py` - User model and password verification
- `backend/config.py` - SECRET_KEY configuration
- Authentication middleware and decorators
```

## Issue 2: High - Database Initialization Flag Persistence

**Title**: `High: Database Initialization Flag Persistence Issue`  
**Priority**: High 🟠  
**Labels**: `database`, `backend`, `bug`, `initialization`, `cloud-run`

**Issue Body**:
```markdown
## Issue Description

**Priority**: High 🟠  
**Component**: Database Initialization  
**Environment**: Production (Cloud Run)

### Problem

The database initialization flag (`app._db_initialized`) is not persisting across Cloud Run instances, causing some endpoints to return "Database not available" errors even after successful initialization.

### Current Behavior

- ✅ Database tables exist and are accessible
- ✅ `/api/db-init-simple` endpoint works correctly
- ✅ `/api/db-inspect` shows database is properly initialized
- ❌ Some endpoints still check `app._db_initialized` flag and fail
- ❌ Flag is instance-specific and doesn't persist across requests

### Root Cause

Cloud Run can spawn multiple instances, and the `app._db_initialized` flag is only set in memory on the instance that performed the initialization. Other instances don't have this flag set.

### Evidence

**Database Inspection Response** (shows DB is working):
```json
{
  "db_initialized": false,  // ❌ False flag
  "tables_exist": true,     // ✅ Tables actually exist
  "users_table_columns": [...], // ✅ Schema is correct
  "status": "success"       // ✅ Connection works
}
```

### Technical Solution Required

Replace the in-memory flag with a database-based check:

```python
def is_database_initialized():
    """Check if database is initialized by verifying table existence."""
    try:
        from sqlalchemy import text
        from models import db
        with db.engine.connect() as conn:
            result = conn.execute(text("""
                SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
                WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'users'
            """))
            return result.scalar() > 0
    except:
        return False
```

### Files to Update

- `backend/app.py` - Replace `app._db_initialized` checks
- Any middleware that checks database initialization status
- Authentication decorators that verify database availability
- Health check endpoints

### Implementation Steps

1. Create `is_database_initialized()` function
2. Replace all `app._db_initialized` references
3. Add caching to avoid repeated database queries
4. Update initialization endpoints to use new check
5. Test across multiple Cloud Run instances

### Impact

- Inconsistent behavior across Cloud Run instances
- Some API endpoints fail unnecessarily
- User experience degraded by false "database not available" errors
- Blocks proper scaling of the application

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test with multiple Cloud Run instances
- [ ] Verify consistent behavior across instances
- [ ] Confirm performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Test initialization check caching

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database initialization check is instance-independent
- [ ] All endpoints work consistently across Cloud Run instances  
- [ ] No false "database not available" errors
- [ ] Initialization check is performant and cached appropriately
- [ ] Health checks accurately reflect database status
```

## Issue Description

**Priority**: Medium 🟡  
**Component**: Deployment Infrastructure  
**Environment**: Production

### Problem

During the database connectivity resolution, multiple Cloud Run services were created with different naming conventions and configurations. The deployment setup needs cleanup and standardization.

### Current State

**Multiple backend services exist**:
- `supplyline-backend-production` (us-west1) - ✅ Working production service
- `supplyline-backend-test` (us-west1) - 🧹 Temporary test service (can be removed)
- Various URL formats causing confusion in documentation

**Service URLs**:
- Production: `https://supplyline-backend-production-sukn4msdrq-uw.a.run.app`
- Test: `https://supplyline-backend-test-454313121816.us-west1.run.app`

### Required Cleanup Actions

#### 1. Remove Temporary Services
```bash
# Remove test service created during debugging
gcloud run services delete supplyline-backend-test --region=us-west1 --quiet
```

#### 2. Standardize Configuration
- Ensure `cloudbuild.yaml` uses correct default substitutions
- Verify all environment variables are properly set
- Confirm Cloud SQL instance connections are correct

#### 3. Update Documentation
- Update all service URL references
- Correct deployment instructions
- Fix any hardcoded URLs in scripts

### Services Audit

**Keep (Production)**:
- `supplyline-backend-production` (us-west1)
- `supplyline-frontend-production` (us-west1)

**Remove (Temporary)**:
- `supplyline-backend-test` (us-west1)
- Any other test/debug services

### Files to Update

- `cloudbuild.yaml` - Ensure correct default substitutions
- `README.md` - Update deployment instructions  
- `GCP_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Update with final configuration
- `scripts/init_database_remote.py` - Use production URLs
- `scripts/test_db_connection.py` - Use production URLs
- Any documentation referencing old service URLs

### Verification Steps

1. **Service Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run services list --region=us-west1
   # Should only show production services
   ```

2. **Frontend Configuration**:
   - Verify frontend connects to correct backend URL
   - Test login flow end-to-end

3. **Deployment Process**:
   - Test full deployment with `gcloud builds submit`
   - Verify all substitutions work correctly

4. **Documentation Accuracy**:
   - Check all URLs in documentation are current
   - Verify deployment instructions are accurate

### Cost Impact
