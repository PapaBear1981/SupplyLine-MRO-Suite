# Login Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis
GitHub Issue #362 reported that the frontend login form was not submitting when users clicked the login button. React event handlers were not executing despite proper form setup.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a combination of factors:
1. **Caching Issue**: The browser was serving an old version of the React bundle
2. **Event Handler Conflict**: The login button had both `type="submit"` and an `onClick` handler, which could interfere with form submission

## Backend Status ✅
The backend API is working perfectly:
- JWT authentication system fully functional
- Login API `/api/auth/login` returns proper tokens
- Database authentication working
- API tested with curl - returns complete JWT response

**Curl Test Result:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:80/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"employee_number":"ADMIN001","password":"admin123"}'
```
Returns complete JWT response with access_token, refresh_token, and user data.

## Frontend Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Added Debug Logging
- Added console.log statements to LoginPage and LoginForm components
- Confirmed React components are now rendering and executing

### 2. Fixed Event Handler Conflict
- Removed conflicting `onClick` handler from submit button
- Button now properly uses `type="submit"` with form's `onSubmit` handler

### 3. Container Rebuild
- Rebuilt frontend Docker container to ensure latest changes are deployed
- Cleared browser cache issues

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx` - Added debug logging
2. `frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.jsx` - Removed conflicting onClick handler

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend API working perfectly
- ✅ Frontend React components rendering
- ✅ Event handlers should now execute properly
- ✅ Docker containers rebuilt and running

## Test Credentials
- Employee Number: `ADMIN001`
- Password: `admin123`

## Next Steps
1. Test the login form in browser
2. Verify form submission works
3. Confirm redirect to dashboard
4. Remove debug logging once confirmed working

## Expected Behavior
1. Navigate to `http://localhost/login`
2. Enter credentials: `ADMIN001` / `admin123`
3. Click "Login" button
4. Form submits, API call made, redirect to dashboard
