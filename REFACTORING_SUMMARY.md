# User Management Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring of the User Management page to provide full management capabilities for Roles and Departments instead of just creation functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Updates

#### `routes_departments.py`
- **Added**: Hard delete endpoint `/api/departments/<id>/hard-delete`
  - Permanently removes a department from the database
  - Requires `user.manage` permission
  - Logs the action for audit purposes

- **Modified**: Soft delete endpoint `/api/departments/<id>` (DELETE)
  - Now properly updates the department in Redux state to mark as inactive
  - Maintains backward compatibility

#### `routes_rbac.py`
- **Modified**: Update role endpoint `/api/roles/<id>` (PUT)
  - System roles can now have their permissions updated
  - System roles still cannot have their name or description changed
  - Returns appropriate error messages for unauthorized modifications

### 2. Frontend Redux Updates

#### `departmentsSlice.js`
- **Added**: `hardDeleteDepartment` async thunk
  - Calls the new hard delete endpoint
  - Removes department from state on success
  
- **Modified**: `deleteDepartment` reducer
  - Now updates the department's `is_active` flag instead of removing it
  - Maintains consistency with soft delete behavior

### 3. New Components Created

#### `PermissionTreeSelector.jsx` (+ CSS)
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/rbac/`

A reusable component for hierarchical permission selection with the following features:
- Expandable/collapsible categories
- Select All / Deselect All per category
- Visual indication of selection state (all, partial, none)
- Permission descriptions displayed
- Total count of selected permissions
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design

**Props**:
- `permissionsByCategory`: Object with permissions grouped by category
- `selectedPermissions`: Array of selected permission IDs
- `onChange`: Callback function when selection changes

#### `DepartmentsManagementModal.jsx` (+ CSS)
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/users/`

A comprehensive modal for managing departments with:
- **List View**: Table showing all departments (active and inactive)
- **Search**: Filter departments by name or description
- **Add**: Create new departments with name and description
- **Edit**: Modify department name and description
- **Toggle Active/Inactive**: Soft delete/restore departments
- **Hard Delete**: Permanently remove departments with confirmation
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Active/Inactive badges
  - Inactive rows styled differently
  - Smooth hover effects and animations

**Features**:
- Real-time search filtering
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Error handling and display
- Loading states
- Responsive table with sticky header

#### `RolesManagementModal.jsx` (+ CSS)
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/users/`

A comprehensive modal for managing roles with:
- **List View**: Table showing all roles with permission counts
- **Search**: Filter roles by name or description
- **Add**: Create new roles with details and permissions
  - Tabbed interface for details and permissions
  - Uses PermissionTreeSelector for permission assignment
- **Edit Details**: Modify role name and description (non-system roles only)
- **Edit Permissions**: Manage role permissions (all roles including system roles)
  - Full permission tree interface
  - Shows current permissions
  - Save/Cancel functionality
- **Delete**: Remove non-system roles with confirmation
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - System role badges
  - Permission count badges
  - Smooth animations

**Features**:
- Separate modals for different operations
- System role protection (can't delete or edit details)
- Permission editing allowed for all roles
- Tabbed interface for complex forms
- Real-time search filtering
- Error handling and display
- Loading states

### 4. UserManagement Component Updates

#### `UserManagement.jsx`
**Changes**:
- **Imports**: Added new modal components
- **Removed**: Old create role/department modal states and handlers
- **Added**: New management modal states
- **Button Changes**:
  - "Create Role" → "Roles"
  - "Create Department" → "Departments"
- **Functionality**: Buttons now open comprehensive management modals instead of simple create forms

**Removed Functions**:
- `handleCreateRole()`
- `handleCreateDepartment()`

**Removed State**:
- `showCreateRoleModal`
- `showCreateDepartmentModal`
- `newRoleData`
- `newDepartmentData`

**Added State**:
- `showRolesManagementModal`
- `showDepartmentsManagementModal`

## API Endpoints

### Departments
- `GET /api/departments?include_inactive=true` - Get all departments
- `POST /api/departments` - Create department
- `PUT /api/departments/<id>` - Update department
- `DELETE /api/departments/<id>` - Soft delete (deactivate)
- `DELETE /api/departments/<id>/hard-delete` - Hard delete (permanent) **[NEW]**

### Roles
- `GET /api/roles` - Get all roles
- `GET /api/roles/<id>` - Get role with permissions
- `POST /api/roles` - Create role
- `PUT /api/roles/<id>` - Update role (now allows permission updates for system roles) **[MODIFIED]**
- `DELETE /api/roles/<id>` - Delete role (non-system only)

### Permissions
- `GET /api/permissions` - Get all permissions
- `GET /api/permissions/categories` - Get permissions grouped by category

## Permission Requirements

All management operations require the `user.manage` permission (for departments) or `role.manage` permission (for roles).

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Consolidated Management**: Single entry point for all department/role operations
2. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Color-coded badges for status
   - Hover effects on interactive elements
3. **Better Organization**: 
   - Hierarchical permission tree
   - Categorized permissions
   - Tabbed interfaces for complex forms
4. **Safety Features**:
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - System role protection
   - Clear warning messages
5. **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Department Management**:
   - Create new departments
   - Edit department details
   - Toggle active/inactive status
   - Hard delete departments
   - Search and filter functionality

2. **Role Management**:
   - Create new roles with permissions
   - Edit role details (non-system roles)
   - Edit permissions (all roles including system)
   - Delete non-system roles
   - Verify system role protection
   - Search and filter functionality

3. **Permission Management**:
   - Select/deselect individual permissions
   - Use category select all/deselect all
   - Expand/collapse categories
   - Verify permission counts
   - Test with different permission combinations

4. **Integration**:
   - Verify changes reflect in user management
   - Check audit logs for all operations
   - Test permission checks
   - Verify error handling

## Notes

- System roles (Administrator, Materials Manager, Maintenance User) cannot be deleted or have their names/descriptions changed, but their permissions can be modified
- Departments use soft delete by default (is_active flag), with hard delete available as a separate action
- All operations are logged in the audit log
- The permission tree selector is reusable and can be used in other parts of the application
