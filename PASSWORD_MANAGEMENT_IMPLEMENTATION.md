# Password Management Features Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of two password management features:
1. **User-Initiated Password Change** - Users can change their password from their profile page
2. **Forced Password Change After Admin Reset** - Users must change their password after an admin reset

## Feature 1: User-Initiated Password Change

### Description
Users can change their own password at any time through the profile page. This feature includes:
- Current password verification
- New password validation with strength requirements
- Password confirmation
- Real-time password strength feedback
- Visual indicators and icons

### User Flow
1. User navigates to their profile page (`/profile`)
2. User clicks on the "Change Password" tab
3. User enters:
   - Current password (for verification)
   - New password
   - Confirmation of new password
4. System validates:
   - Current password is correct
   - New password meets strength requirements
   - New password matches confirmation
   - New password is not in the last 5 passwords used
5. Upon success, password is updated and user receives confirmation

### Files Modified

#### Frontend
- **`frontend/src/pages/ProfilePageNew.jsx`**
  - Enhanced password change tab with better UI/UX
  - Added visual icons and indicators
  - Improved password requirements display
  - Added real-time password matching feedback
  - Better button states and loading indicators

#### Backend
- **`backend/routes.py`** (Line 2112-2180)
  - Endpoint: `PUT /api/user/password`
  - Already implemented with comprehensive validation
  - Includes JWT session validation
  - Password strength validation
  - Password reuse checking
  - Activity logging

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)
- Cannot match any of the last 5 passwords

### Security Features
- Current password verification required
- JWT session validation (prevents stale token usage)
- Password strength validation
- Password history checking (prevents reuse of last 5 passwords)
- Activity logging for audit trail
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)

## Feature 2: Forced Password Change After Admin Reset

### Description
When an administrator resets a user's password, the user is flagged to change their password on next login. The user cannot access the application until they set a new password.

### User Flow
1. Admin resets user's password (generates temporary password)
2. System sets `force_password_change = True` flag on user account
3. User logs in with temporary password
4. System detects `force_password_change` flag
5. Login endpoint returns special response: `PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED`
6. Frontend displays non-dismissible modal
7. User must set new password before proceeding
8. Upon successful password change:
   - `force_password_change` flag is cleared
   - User is authenticated with new password
   - JWT tokens are set
   - User is redirected to dashboard

### Files Created

#### Frontend
- **`frontend/src/components/auth/ForcedPasswordChangeModal.jsx`** (NEW)
  - Non-dismissible modal component
  - Cannot be closed by clicking outside or pressing ESC
  - Includes password strength meter
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Visual warnings and instructions

### Files Modified

#### Frontend
- **`frontend/src/services/authService.js`**
  - Updated `login()` method to detect `PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED` response
  - Returns special object with temporary credentials when password change is required

- **`frontend/src/store/authSlice.js`**
  - Added `passwordChangeRequired` state
  - Added `passwordChangeData` state (stores employee number and temporary password)
  - Added `clearPasswordChangeRequired` action
  - Updated login fulfilled handler to detect password change requirement
  - Prevents authentication when password change is required

- **`frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`**
  - Added state management for forced password change modal
  - Displays `ForcedPasswordChangeModal` when needed
  - Handles successful password change and redirects to dashboard

#### Backend
- **`backend/routes_auth.py`**
  - Added password validation utilities import
  - Enhanced `/api/auth/change-password` endpoint (Line 407-479)
  - Improved password strength validation
  - Better error messages with details

- **`backend/routes_password_reset.py`** (Line 37-116)
  - Admin password reset endpoint already sets `force_password_change = True`
  - Generates secure temporary password
  - Logs admin action for audit trail

### Backend Endpoints

#### Login Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/login`
- **Response when password change required**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Password change required",
    "code": "PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED",
    "user_id": 123,
    "employee_number": "EMP001"
  }
  ```
- **Status Code**: 200

#### Forced Password Change Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/change-password`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "employee_number": "EMP001",
    "current_password": "temporary_password",
    "new_password": "NewSecurePassword123!"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Password changed successfully",
    "user": { ... },
    "access_token": "...",
    "refresh_token": "..."
  }
  ```
- **Status Code**: 200

### Security Features
- Modal is non-dismissible (cannot be closed)
- User cannot navigate away without changing password
- Temporary password is only stored in memory (not persisted)
- Full password strength validation
- Password reuse prevention
- Activity and audit logging
- JWT tokens only issued after successful password change

   - Wrong current password
   - Weak new password
   - Mismatched password confirmation
   - Reused password (if available)
5. Test valid scenario:

### Automated Testing
Consider adding E2E tests using Playwright for:
- User-initiated password change flow
- Forced password change flow
- Password validation rules
- Error handling

## Database Schema

### User Model Fields
- `password_hash`: Hashed password (bcrypt)
- `force_password_change`: Boolean flag
- `password_changed_at`: Timestamp of last password change
- `failed_login_attempts`: Counter for account lockout
- `account_locked_until`: Timestamp for lockout expiry

### PasswordHistory Model
- `id`: Primary key
- `user_id`: Foreign key to User
- `password_hash`: Historical password hash
- `created_at`: Timestamp

---

## Configuration

### Password Policy (backend/security_config.py)
```python
PASSWORD_POLICY = {
    'min_length': 8,
    'require_uppercase': True,
    'require_lowercase': True,
    'require_digits': True,
    'require_special': True,
    'history_limit': 5,
    'max_age_days': 90,
}
```

   - More sophisticated strength calculation
   - Dictionary attack prevention
   - Common password blacklist

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Optional 2FA for password changes
   - SMS or authenticator app support

4. **Self-Service Password Reset**
   - Email-based password reset
   - Security questions
   - Account recovery options

5. **Password Change History**
   - View password change history in profile
   - Track who changed password (user vs admin)

---

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: User can't change password - "Current password is incorrect"
- **Solution**: Verify user is entering correct current password
- **Check**: Account lockout status

**Issue**: Password change modal won't close
- **Solution**: This is by design - user must change password
- **Workaround**: Contact admin to clear force_password_change flag

**Issue**: Password doesn't meet requirements
- **Solution**: Review password requirements in modal
- **Check**: Ensure all criteria are met (length, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special char)

### Admin Actions

**Clear force_password_change flag** (if needed):
```sql
UPDATE users SET force_password_change = FALSE WHERE id = <user_id>;
```

**Check password change history**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM password_history WHERE user_id = <user_id> ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
