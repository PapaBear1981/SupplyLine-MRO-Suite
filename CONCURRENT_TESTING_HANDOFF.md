## ‚úÖ What Was Completed

### 1. Core Testing Framework (`frontend/tests/e2e/utils/concurrent-helpers.js`)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and fully functional

**Features Implemented**:
- `createConcurrentUsers(count, users)` - Creates multiple authenticated browser contexts
  - Sequential creation with 500ms delays to prevent server overload
  - Automatic login for each user
  - Returns array of `{browser, context, page, user}` objects

- `executeConcurrently(operations)` - Runs operations simultaneously
  - Uses `Promise.all()` for true concurrency
  - Returns detailed execution results with timing metrics

- `executeStaggered(operations, staggerMs)` - Runs operations with delays
  - Configurable delay between each operation
  - Useful for testing sequential access patterns

- `analyzeResults(results)` - Provides detailed metrics
  - Success/failure counts and rates
  - Duration statistics (total, avg, max, min)
  - Error categorization and breakdown

- `ConcurrencyBarrier` - Synchronization primitive
  - Ensures all users start operations at exactly the same time
  - Critical for testing true race conditions

- `cleanupConcurrentUsers(contexts)` - Cleanup utility
  - Closes all browsers and contexts
  - Prevents resource leaks

**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Proven to work with 3 concurrent users

---

## üöß What Remains To Be Done

### Priority 1: Fix UI Selector Issues (High Priority)

#### Task 1.1: Fix Chemical Issuance Test Selectors

**File**: `frontend/tests/e2e/concurrent-chemicals.spec.js`
**Lines**: 21-147 (Test 1)

**Current Issue**:
```javascript
// This selector doesn't work:
const issueBtn = row.locator('button:has-text("Issue")');
await issueBtn.click({ timeout: 5000 }); // TIMEOUT
```

**How to Fix**:
1. Use Playwright MCP server to navigate to `/chemicals` page
2. Inspect the actual table structure:
   ```javascript
   npx playwright codegen http://localhost:5173/chemicals
   ```
3. Find the correct selector for the Issue button
4. Update the test with correct selectors

**Expected Table Structure** (from previous inspection):
- Columns: Part Number (1), Lot Number (2), Description (3), Manufacturer (4), Quantity (5), Warehouse (6), Expiration Date (7), Status (8), Actions (9)
- Issue button is likely in the Actions column (9th column)

**Suggested Fix**:
```javascript
// Option 1: Use the Actions column
const actionsCell = row.locator('td:nth-child(9)');
const issueBtn = actionsCell.locator('button:has-text("Issue")');

// Option 2: Use more specific selector
const issueBtn = row.locator('button[aria-label="Issue"], button:text-is("Issue")');

// Option 3: Navigate to details page first (like tools)
const viewBtn = row.locator('button:has-text("View")');
await viewBtn.click();
// Then find Issue button on details page
```

**Testing Steps**:
1. Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/concurrent-chemicals.spec.js --headed --project=chromium`
2. Watch the browser to see where it fails
3. Use browser DevTools to inspect the actual DOM
4. Update selectors accordingly
5. Re-run until test passes

#### Task 1.2: Fix Calibration Test Selectors

**File**: `frontend/tests/e2e/concurrent-calibrations.spec.js`
**Lines**: 20-151 (Test 1)

**Current Issue**:
```javascript
// This selector doesn't work:
const toolSelect = firstPage.locator('select[name="tool_id"]');
await toolSelect.waitFor({ state: 'visible', timeout: 5000 }); // TIMEOUT
```

**How to Fix**:
1. Navigate to the calibration page/form first
2. Inspect the actual form structure
3. Update selectors to match

**Suggested Approach**:
```javascript
// Navigate to calibrations page
await page.goto('/calibrations', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });

// Click "Add Calibration" or similar button
const addBtn = page.locator('button:has-text("Add"), button:has-text("New Calibration")');
await addBtn.click();

// Wait for form/modal
await page.waitForSelector('form, .modal, [role="dialog"]');

// Then find the tool select
const toolSelect = page.locator('select[name="tool_id"], select[id="tool_id"]');
```

**Testing Steps**:
1. Manually navigate to calibrations page in browser
2. Click "Add Calibration" button
3. Inspect the form elements
4. Update test with correct navigation and selectors
5. Run test: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/concurrent-calibrations.spec.js --headed`





### Priority 2: Expand Test Coverage (Medium Priority)

#### Task 2.1: Add Real Checkout Collision Test

**Goal**: Test what happens when 3 users try to checkout the same tool simultaneously

**Current State**: Simplified to API-only test due to UI complexity

**How to Implement**:
1. First, get the checkout flow working for a single user
2. Use Playwright codegen to record the exact steps:
   ```bash
   npx playwright codegen http://localhost:5173/tools
   ```
3. Record: Navigate to tools ‚Üí Find available tool ‚Üí Click View ‚Üí Click Checkout ‚Üí Fill form ‚Üí Submit
4. Extract the selectors from the recording
5. Implement the concurrent test

**Expected Behavior**:
- Only 1 user should successfully checkout the tool
- The other 2 should get an error (tool already checked out)
- This tests database locking and race condition handling

#### Task 2.2: Add Chemical Over-Issuance Prevention Test

**Goal**: Verify system prevents issuing more chemicals than available

**Scenario**:
- Chemical has 2 units available
- 4 users try to issue 1 unit each simultaneously
- Only 2 should succeed

#### Task 2.3: Add Concurrent Calibration Test

**Goal**: Verify multiple users can add calibrations to the same tool

**Expected Behavior**: All should succeed (multiple calibrations allowed per tool)

### Priority 3: Performance Testing (Low Priority)

#### Task 3.1: Increase User Count

**Current**: Tests use 3 concurrent users
**Goal**: Test with 5, 10, 20, 50 users

**How to Implement**:
1. Update `userCount` variable in tests
2. Ensure you have enough test users in the database
3. Monitor performance metrics

**Note**: You may need to create additional test users in `backend/tests/seed_e2e_test_data.py`

#### Task 3.2: Add Load Testing Metrics

**Goal**: Measure system performance under sustained load

**Suggested Approach**:
1. Create a test that runs 100+ requests over 60 seconds
2. Measure: Average response time, 95th percentile, Error rate, Database connection pool usage

## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue 1: Login Timeout with 5+ Users

**Symptom**: When creating 5 or more concurrent users, some logins timeout

**Error**:
```
TimeoutError: page.waitForURL: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.
waiting for navigation until "networkidle"
```

**Root Cause**: Creating too many users too quickly overwhelms the backend

**Current Workaround**:
- Limited tests to 3 users
- Added 500ms delay between user creation in `concurrent-helpers.js` (line 46)

**Permanent Fix Needed**:
1. Increase backend capacity (more workers, connection pooling)
2. OR increase delay between user creation to 1000ms
3. OR create all users upfront in global setup, reuse them in tests

### Issue 2: UI Selectors Are Fragile

**Symptom**: Tests break when UI changes

**Root Cause**: Using generic selectors like `button:has-text("Issue")`

**Recommendation**: Add `data-testid` attributes to UI components

**Example**:
```jsx
// In ChemicalList.jsx
<button data-testid="issue-chemical-btn" onClick={handleIssue}>
  Issue
</button>

// In test
const issueBtn = row.locator('[data-testid="issue-chemical-btn"]');
```

**Benefits**:
- Tests are more stable
- Selectors are more readable
- UI can change without breaking tests

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add `data-testid` to all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, forms)
2. Update tests to use `data-testid` selectors
3. Document the convention in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Issue 3: Test Data Cleanup

**Symptom**: Tests may leave data in database

**Current State**: Global setup resets database before each test run

**Issue**: If tests fail mid-execution, data may be left behind

**Recommendation**: Add cleanup in test `finally` blocks

npx playwright test tests/e2e/concurrent-checkouts.spec.js --headed

# Generate HTML report
npx playwright test tests/e2e/concurrent-checkouts.spec.js --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

### Step 3: Fix Chemical Tests (Start Here)

**Recommended Approach**:

1. **Use Playwright Codegen to Record Selectors**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright codegen http://localhost:5173/chemicals
   ```
   - Login as ADMIN001 / admin123
   - Navigate to chemicals page
   - Click Issue button on a chemical
   - Fill out the form
   - Submit
   - Copy the generated code

2. **Update Test with Recorded Selectors**:
   - Open `frontend/tests/e2e/concurrent-chemicals.spec.js`
   - Replace lines 68-90 with the recorded code
   - Adjust for concurrent execution (add barrier.wait())

3. **Test Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/e2e/concurrent-chemicals.spec.js --headed --project=chromium
   ```

4. **Verify Results**:
   - Test should pass
   - Check that quantity decreases correctly
   - Verify no race conditions

### Step 4: Fix Calibration Tests

Follow same process as Step 3, but for calibrations page

### Step 5: Add New Tests

Use the templates in Priority 2 section above

### Step 6: Run Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Generate report
npx playwright test --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report
```

## üìö Testing Instructions

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Prerequisites
cd frontend
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/concurrent-checkouts.spec.js

# Run all concurrent tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/concurrent-*.spec.js

# Run with different reporters
npx playwright test --reporter=list          # Simple list
npx playwright test --reporter=html          # HTML report
npx playwright test --reporter=json          # JSON output

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug                  # Step through tests
npx playwright test --headed                 # See browser
npx playwright test --ui                     # Interactive UI mode

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test -g "concurrent API requests"
```

### Interpreting Results

**Success Output**:

```
‚úì should handle 3 users making concurrent API requests (5.6s)

=== Concurrent API Request Results ===
{
  "totalOperations": 3,
  "successCount": 3,
  "failureCount": 0,
  "successRate": "100.00%",
  "totalDuration": 63,
  "avgDuration": "52.67",
  "maxDuration": 63,
  "minDuration": 46
}
```

**What to Look For**:

- ‚úÖ `successRate: "100.00%"` - All operations succeeded
- ‚úÖ `avgDuration < 100ms` - Fast response times
- ‚úÖ `uniqueErrors: []` - No errors occurred

**Failure Output**:

```
‚úò should handle 3 users issuing chemicals (23.7s)

Error: locator.click: Timeout 5000ms exceeded.
```

**What to Do**:

1. Check the error message for clues
2. Look at screenshots in `test-results/` directory
3. Run with `--headed` to see what's happening
4. Use `--debug` to step through the test

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.js                        # Login utilities

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ playwright.config.js               # Playwright configuration
```

### How It Works

1. **Global Setup** (`global-setup.js`):
   - Runs before all tests
   - Resets database
   - Seeds test data (5 users, 5 tools, 2 chemicals, 2 kits)

2. **Concurrent Helpers** (`concurrent-helpers.js`):
   - Creates multiple authenticated browser contexts
   - Provides synchronization primitives (barriers)
   - Executes operations concurrently or staggered
   - Analyzes and reports results

3. **Test Suites**:
   - Each suite tests a specific feature area
   - Tests use barriers to ensure true concurrency
   - Results are analyzed for race conditions

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Each test cleans up its browser contexts
   - Database is reset before next test run

### Key Concepts

**Concurrency Barrier**:

```javascript
const barrier = new ConcurrencyBarrier(3);

// All 3 users wait here until everyone arrives
await barrier.wait();

// Then all proceed simultaneously
```

**Concurrent Execution**:

```javascript
const operations = users.map(user => async () => {
  await barrier.wait();  // Synchronize
  return await doSomething();  // Execute
});

const results = await executeConcurrently(operations);
```

**Result Analysis**:

```javascript
{
  totalOperations: 3,
  successCount: 3,
  failureCount: 0,
  successRate: "100.00%",
  avgDuration: "52.67",
  uniqueErrors: [],
  errorBreakdown: []
}
```

## üìù Important Notes

### Test Users

The following test users are created in `global-setup.js`:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| ADMIN001 | admin123 | Administrator |
| USER001 | user123 | Maintenance User |
| MAT001 | materials123 | Materials Manager |
| MAINT001 | user123 | Maintenance User |
| ENG001 | user123 | Maintenance User |

**Note**: Tests currently use only the first 3 users to avoid login timeouts

### Test Data

Each test run starts with fresh data:

- **5 Tools**: T001-T005 (Digital Multimeter, Torque Wrench, Oscilloscope, Impact Wrench, Micrometer)
- **2 Chemicals**: CHEM001 (Cleaning Solvent, 10 units), CHEM002 (Lubricant, 5 units)
- **3 Warehouses**: Main Warehouse, Satellite Warehouse A, Satellite Warehouse B
- **2 Kits**: Boeing 737 Kit, Airbus A320 Kit
- **1 Checkout**: T003 checked out to ADMIN001

### Performance Benchmarks

Based on current test results:

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| API Response Time (avg) | 52ms | <100ms | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| API Response Time (max) | 63ms | <200ms | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Concurrent Users | 3 | 10+ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited by login timeout |
| Success Rate | 100% | 100% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
