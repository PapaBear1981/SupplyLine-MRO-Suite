```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PapaBear1981/SupplyLine-MRO-Suite.git
cd SupplyLine-MRO-Suite

# Create environment file from template
cp .env.example .env

# Generate secure keys (REQUIRED)
python -c "import secrets; print('SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(64))" >> .env
python -c "import secrets; print('JWT_SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(64))" >> .env

# Build and start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application at http://localhost
```

### Docker Deployment Features

The Docker deployment includes:
1. **Backend Container**: Flask API with SQLite database
2. **Frontend Container**: Nginx serving React application
3. **Persistent Volumes**: Database and session data preserved across restarts
4. **Health Checks**: Automatic container health monitoring
5. **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints for stability
6. **Network Isolation**: Containers communicate on isolated network

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker-compose down

# Rebuild containers after code changes
docker-compose up -d --build

# Remove all data (including database)
docker-compose down -v
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployments:
1. Update the `.env` file with production values
2. Set `FLASK_ENV=production` and `FLASK_DEBUG=False`
3. Generate strong, unique values for `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
4. Configure appropriate `CORS_ORIGINS` for your domain
5. Consider using a reverse proxy (like Traefik or Nginx) for SSL/TLS
6. Set up regular database backups of the `database` volume

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- Python (v3.11+)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Local Development Setup

##### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask server
python app.py
```

##### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

#### Option 2: Docker Deployment

See the **Docker Deployment** section above for complete instructions on deploying with Docker and Docker Compose.

### QR Code Configuration for External Devices

By default, QR codes generated by the system use `localhost` URLs, which only work on the same machine. To make QR codes scannable from phones and other external devices:

1. **Find your server's network IP address**:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   ipconfig
   # Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter

   # On macOS/Linux
   ifconfig
   # or
   ip addr show
   ```

2. **Set the PUBLIC_URL environment variable**:
   ```bash
   # In your .env file, add:
   PUBLIC_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000
   # Replace 192.168.1.100 with your actual IP address
   ```

3. **Restart the backend server** for the changes to take effect.

4. **Test the QR code**: Generate a QR code for a tool or chemical, scan it with your phone, and verify it opens the correct page.

**Note**: For production deployments, use your domain name instead:
```bash
PUBLIC_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Testing

Run the automated test suites to validate JWT authentication and overall functionality.

### Backend Unit Tests

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

These tests verify login, protected routes, and the refresh token flow.

### End-to-End Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright tests inject JWT tokens to emulate authenticated users.
