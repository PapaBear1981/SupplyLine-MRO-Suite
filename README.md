### CI/CD Integration

E2E tests run automatically in GitHub Actions on:
- Push to main/master/develop branches
- Pull requests to main branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

The CI pipeline tests across multiple browsers and generates comprehensive reports with screenshots and videos for failed tests.

### Test Data Management

Tests use predefined test data and fixtures to ensure consistency:
- Test users (admin, regular user, materials user)
- Test tools with various configurations
- Test chemicals and inventory items
- Test cycle count schedules and batches

For detailed testing documentation, see `frontend/tests/e2e/README.md`.
