## Forced Password Change After Admin Reset

### What Happens When Admin Resets Your Password

   - Your account is flagged for mandatory password change

2. **Login with Temporary Password**
   - Navigate to the login page
   - Enter your employee number
   - Enter the temporary password provided by the admin

3. **Forced Password Change Modal**
   - Instead of going to the dashboard, you'll see a modal:
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Password Change Required"**
     - Yellow header indicating action needed
     - Information about why you must change your password
   - **Important**: This modal cannot be closed or dismissed
   - You must change your password to continue

   - Don't use family names or pet names

   - Use a different password for this system

4. **Use a Password Manager**
   - Consider using a password manager
   - Generates and stores strong passwords
   - You only need to remember one master password

   - Not with coworkers
   - Not with IT support
   - Not with anyone

2. **Don't Write It Down**
   - Don't keep it on a sticky note

   - Use a password manager instead

3. **Change It Regularly**
   - Change your password every 90 days
   - Change it immediately if you suspect compromise

4. **Be Aware of Phishing**
   - Don't enter your password on suspicious websites
   - Verify you're on the correct login page
   - Look for HTTPS in the URL
